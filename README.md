Tracking spike gene target failure at UW Virology

This preliminary dataset shows counts of SGTF detected by TaqPath PCR assays performed at UW Virology starting December 2021.

These are not confirmed Omicron cases--sequencing results lag by about a week. Sequences are deposited to GISAID and Genbank. 

County counts are based on the site where the sample was received and not county of residence.
